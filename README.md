# Password Manager

This simple password manager project, created by Emmanuel Tetteh, allows users to generate strong passwords and store them securely. The application is built using the Tkinter library in Python.

## Features

- **Password Generation:** The program can generate random passwords with a mix of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols.

- **Save Passwords:** Users can input website details, email/username, and passwords, and save them for future reference.

- **User Interface (UI):** The application has a user-friendly interface with entry fields, buttons, and an option to generate passwords.

## How to Use

1. Run the program using a Python interpreter.
2. Input website details, email/username, and generate or enter a password.
3. Click the "Generate Password" button for a random password or manually enter one.
4. Click the "Add" button to save the entered details.

## Dependencies

- Tkinter
- pyperclip

## Files

- `password_manager.py`: The main script for the password manager.
- `logo.png`: Logo image used in the Tkinter canvas.
- `data.txt`: Text file where password details are stored.

## How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed. Run the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python password_manager.py
```
## Note
Make sure to keep your data.txt file secure, as it contains sensitive information. Additionally, you can customize the program further based on your needs.
